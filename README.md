# Albany Cocktail Menu

A mobile-friendly cocktail menu built with React, Tailwind CSS, and AWS designed so guests at my home can scan a QR code and browse all the drinks I can make for them.

## Purpose

I created this app as a personal, scannable **cocktail menu for friends visiting my home**. Instead of flipping through notes or reciting from memory, guests can scan a **QR code** at the bar and instantly view drink options complete with photos, ingredients, and fun names.

## How It Works

1. **Scan the QR Code** placed on my coasters or fridge.
2. **Browse drink options** (cocktails only wines by verbal request).
3. **Filter by your vibe** – want something strong, sweet, or tropical?
4. **Order from the bartender** (me) based on what's listed. Cheers!
