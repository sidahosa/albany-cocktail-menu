          <Typography variant="body1">
            Fancy a classy evening? Grab a glass of red, white, or whatever color makes you feel sophisticated
            (we don‚Äôt judge if it comes from a box). Whether you're swirling your glass like a sommelier or just
            looking for something that pairs well with watching Netflix in pajamas, I got you covered.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Some people like their drinks on the rocks. Others prefer them right down the hatch.
            If you like whiskey, tequila, vodka, rum, or anything that makes your throat question your life choices,
            this is your safe space. Raise a glass and take that shot. No salt, no lime? Respect.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Not in the mood for anything fancy? No problem.
            Just grab your favorite liquor and throw in some soda, juice, or whatever‚Äôs left in your fridge.
            Boom‚Äîinstant drink! Whether it‚Äôs rum and coke, vodka and cranberry, or whiskey and bad decisions,
            we respect the simplicity of a solid mixed drink.
